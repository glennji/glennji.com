Language is the medium for the transmission of ideas: the vector for meme activity, perhaps. It also appears to be something which differentiates humans from other animals (although perhaps whale-song or even bird-call is more complex than suspected).
<blockquote>
<div><i>In "Human Traces", Sebastian Faulk suggests (through his characters) that language developed with consciousness; the two are inextricable. Further, he suggests that our ability to abstract (reality is an abstraction) the world and hear the voices of leaders/kings/<a href="http://glennji.com/lexicon/god/">gods</a> are both part of (the main function of?) consciousness.</i></div>
<em>When we developed writing, he says, we found a way to express language that didn't require us to hallucinate voices -- and this is why so-called gods and spirits stopped talking to us. It's a nice idea; it explains how religion could have evolved from a time of prophets and leaders to one of "faith" as a virtue.</em></blockquote>
