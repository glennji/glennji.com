I've really got to figure out how I should be spending my time -- what things I'd like to try, the things I like doing, ways to diversify income and how I might make the world a better place. Even if I can become functionally immortal (and there's no guarantees), time is one thing we can't recycle.
<ul>
 	<li>TV and music I like</li>
 	<li>games we play</li>
 	<li>hobbies</li>

</ul>
Some notes from an earlier incarnation:
<ul>
 	<li>Writing code that can make a real positive difference to peoples' lives
<ul>
 	<li>Open source</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Releasing Android software</li>
 	<li>Running a low-touch, high-income business
<ul>
 	<li>online business models
7 models for doing business online.
<ul>
 	<li>Physical goods
Stuff you have to deliver offline.</li>
 	<li>Publishing
The sale of data, whether it be digital or   physical books, entertainment, videos, software, databases, or  any other form. This is the only pure online model that  involves hard goods that doesn't fall into the Physical model.</li>
 	<li>Community
You're selling access to a group of other people  with similar interests.</li>
 	<li>Leads
You get 'em, then you sell 'em.</li>
 	<li>Traffic
This one confuses people. It encompasses a lot of  methods, but the product comes down to one thing: You get paid  for sending visitors to someone's site.</li>
 	<li>Advertising space
This specifically refers to ads you get paid for based on time posted or number of exposures, not on results.  Results-based payment puts it under leads or traffic.</li>
 	<li>Services
Personally rendered or via software. It's something  you (or your staff or computers) do, not something you deliver.</li>
</ul>
