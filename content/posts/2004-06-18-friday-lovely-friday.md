    Got through another week, and very happy to have done so. It&#8217;s been quite hectic this week, with a software release today (which we postponed thanks to network issues &#8211; the other company in our building does web-streaming every Friday, it seems, and we share the Internet connection). Moreover, the release was/is to be on the new deployment platform, and that&#8217;s a whole different can of worms (remember the good ol&#8217; days, when worms came in old fashioned paper bags, not cans?), with the biggest worm being &#8220;trial&#8221; licenses.<br /> Anyone out there know a software house that keeps up with all the licenses they&#8217;re meant to? C&#8217;mon, be honest.<br /> It doesn&#8217;t matter now, I got all my work for the release finished so I&#8217;m the good guy (or at very least, not the hold-up &#8211; the fabled &#8220;critical path&#8221;). A couple more test releases and we go into a &#8220;model&#8221; environment, then production. Now I&#8217;ve written production code before, for telcos no less, but this project is a salvage job and thus my personal confidence in it&#8217;s quality is notably low. I hope it all works, I really do.<br /> Guess I&#8217;ve got those &#8220;couple more test releases&#8221; to make sure, huh?<br /> And now I need to make a snack (alcohol beckons).<br /> Have I talked about the alcohol-centric social structure of middle-class Australia? No doubt I will one of these days (consider that a warning!).
